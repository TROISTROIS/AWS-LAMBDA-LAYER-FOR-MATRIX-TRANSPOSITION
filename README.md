# AWS-LAMBDA-LAYER-FOR-MATRIX-TRANSPOSITION
<br>
This project focuses on the creation of a Python function capable of transposing a 2-dimensional matrix of numbers, packaging this function as a reusable AWS Lambda Layer, and then utilizing this layer in a separate AWS Lambda function. This task will demonstrate the reusability of code in cloud environments, specifically within AWS, and introduce the concept of Lambda Layers as a means to share code, libraries, and other dependencies across multiple Lambda functions.<br>

# Objectives
1. Develop a Python function to transpose a 2D matrix. <br>
2. Package this function into an AWS Lambda Layer for reuse. <br>
3. Create a new AWS Lambda function that utilizes this layer to perform matrix transposition.<br>
